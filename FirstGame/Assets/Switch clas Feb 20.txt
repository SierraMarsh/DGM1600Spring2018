// Here is what I learned in class today, which was actually very fun for me, was about scripts. This is showing us how to create
//variarions on case by case basis. Get it? lol
//So here is the example for the module video

	//I did not do this, it was done for me. BUt this is a great example of us saying that if we have intellegence in
	//objects that if we define the int of that with object will print based on what we defined as. So today in class we
	//did Powerups where we made scriptable objects with abigger box script full of switches that tells out objects "if I am
	// this than do this. So far we've only learned how to make things print but the idea is over arching.

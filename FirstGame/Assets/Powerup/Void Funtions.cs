		//what it is you are about to do. In class the Professor showed us how you can name a void function and then just use the name to copy and paste the function
		//in other code, which i think is the most useful things we've learned so far. 
		//So lets say we say

		Public Void ReadyPlayerOne
		//Do work

		//Meaning that we now defined the voice function and after telling it what work to do we can then call that function at any point in out game.

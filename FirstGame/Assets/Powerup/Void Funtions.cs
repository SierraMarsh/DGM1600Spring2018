		//what it is you are about to do. In class the Professor showed us how you can name a void function and then just use the name to copy and paste the function
		//in other code, which i think is the most useful things we've learned so far. 
		//So lets say we say

		//Public Void ReadyPlayerOne
		//Do work

		//Meaning that we now defined the voice function and after telling it what work to do we can then call that function at any point in out game.

		//3/8/2018 Lets talk Scope and access modifiers. THese tell the game how much access the public or players have to your data. Public means
		//what you are coding can be found easily while privet means it cant be seen and stays in your code. These are 
		//defining characteristics that tell your code how to be precived by other people. THese are public, protected, internal and private.
		//so lets talk scripting use. We have a function that we want to keep to ourselves. We could write Private void Personal

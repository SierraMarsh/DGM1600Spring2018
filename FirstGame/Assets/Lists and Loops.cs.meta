//Okay so today in class we learned about List, thanks for asking. My grasp on unity is so/so but this is a bounce off of Arrays which is nice and tidy. 
Arrays are a set amount of things that all behave teh same way, a list doenst need to have a cap off amount and can have data added to it while in the game. You leave it as a open ended insert here type set up. In Unity you
can limit it if you want but you dont have too. 

So today in class we created a script that would let the player list The incredibles using something like this '


using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;
using UnityEngine.ui;

public class ListsandLoops : MonoBehaviour {
public TheIncredibles TheIncredibles;
public string AddMember;


public string [] PlayerNames;
public List<string> PlayerNameList;
    void Start () {


        TheIncredibles.FamilyList.Add("AddMember");

(I copied and pasted this, its not from memory. Because I suck. At life.)

The module video has us set up something smiliar, there it wants us to list bad guys.
 So it makes the public class BADGUY
sets it up with a string and a int.

then when its time to make the list, one item will look like this badguys.Add( new Badguy("Riddler", 10));
This sets it us as a part of the badguy list, the name and number for it are defined.

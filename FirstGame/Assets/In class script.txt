//Here is what I understand from class, which is not much but I am trying. I do see now what was said about this being english. I understand variable from already knowing 
the language. So in a function like print, a variable is the changable part of the code. The thing that can be changed as a insert here type thing. So I can use  Int to 
define a changing number to tell the user how much of something the player or a object in the code has. I could use names as a variable and once you define the name
that object is know related to it.
